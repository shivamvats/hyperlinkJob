#hyperlinkJob

###Motivation

Many at times, we get interrupted while working on or doing something. Say you
are editing a couple of files related to a project and suddenly something more
urgent comes up. Often, you will not remember to keep the original files open if
the interruption lasted long enough. Most people will simply forget that they
were working on that project if it isn't immediately important. Some people
might take a note somewhere to get back to that project.

This application is for the latter group of people.

###Goal

For doing something, we usually need to open a couple applications. If you are
writing a report, you might open your favourite editor, a couple of tabs in the
web-browser for searching and possibly a pdf for reference. When you take a note
to get back at this job later, you do not note the setup that you using. The
next time, you might forget which book you were using for reference etc.

The goal is to save this information somewhere and make it available via a
hyperlink. So the user will simply save a unique hyperlink along with his note
so that next time when he restarts the job, he gets to exact same setup he had
earlier.
